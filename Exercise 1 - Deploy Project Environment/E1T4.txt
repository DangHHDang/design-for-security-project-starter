Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
- IAM Role (InstanceRole) has full access to any s3 bucket instance. Again, violation of the
least privilege principle. Roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions
performed upon them.

# Poor practice 2
- The WebAppSG security group permits ingress traffic from the internet to multiple ports exposing the server to attacks. It also allows all egress traffic to any IP address.
